### Creating the Polls app

  [Click here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app)

### Database Setup

  [Click here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/#database-setup)

  NOTE: Skip `Introducing the Django Admin` as it might be advanced for complete beginner

### Creation Question View, Route

  Use following lines in `polls/views.py`

  ```
  from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render

  from .models import Question

  def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Namaste, World. You are at the polls index")

  def detail(request, question_id):
    question = get_object_or_404(Question, pk=question_id)
    return render(request, 'polls/detail.html', {'question': question})
  ```

  And, set path in `polls/urls.py`:

  ```
  from django.urls import path

  from . import views

  urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
  ]
  ```

  And, template file `polls/templates/polls/detail.html`:

  ```
  <h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>
  <ul>
    {% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
        <li>{{ choice.choice_text }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  ```

**NOTE:** If you type `/polls/2` then you will get error since you haven't created question with id 2.
